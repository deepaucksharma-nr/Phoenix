## üéØ Key Findings Summary

### Overall Alignment: **~65%**

| Component | Status | Gap |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| **CLI Commands** | 11/17 (65%) | 6 commands missing |
| **Control Plane** | 3.5/4 (85%) | Pipeline deployer incomplete |
| **Operators** | 1/2 (50%) | LoadSim operator is stub |
| **Web Console** | 2/4 (60%) | 2 views missing |
| **OTel Configs** | 3/5 (60%) | 2 pipeline configs missing |
| **Load Simulation** | 1/5 (20%) | Almost entirely missing |

### Critical Gaps Requiring Immediate Attention:

1. **Load Simulation System** (CRITICAL)
   - Missing operator implementation
   - No CLI commands
   - No load generator

2. **Pipeline Management CLI** (HIGH)
   - Missing 6 essential commands
   - No validation or status checking

3. **Web Console Views** (MEDIUM)
   - No deployed pipelines monitoring
   - No pipeline catalog browser

## üöÄ Recommended Implementation Path

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Foundation
**Priority**: Complete critical missing infrastructure
- Implement LoadSim Operator controller
- Add missing CLI pipeline commands  
- Complete Pipeline Deployer Service

### Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Core Features
**Priority**: Build remaining functionality
- Implement load generator with all profiles
- Create missing Web Console views
- Add missing OTel pipeline configurations

### Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6): Integration & Polish
**Priority**: Quality and completeness
- Implement all 13 acceptance tests
- Add missing CLI features (watch, output formats)
- Performance optimization and documentation

## üìä Success Metrics

### Technical Goals:
- ‚úÖ All 17 CLI commands functional
- ‚úÖ Both K8s operators working
- ‚úÖ All 4 Web Console views complete
- ‚úÖ All 5 OTel pipeline configs validated
- ‚úÖ Load simulation generating realistic patterns

### Performance Goals:
- ‚úÖ < 5% collector overhead
- ‚úÖ < 10 min pipeline deployment
- ‚úÖ < 60 min experiment results  
- ‚úÖ ‚â• 50% cardinality reduction
- ‚úÖ 100% critical process retention

### Quality Goals:
- ‚úÖ All 13 PRD acceptance tests pass
- ‚úÖ >80% unit test coverage
- ‚úÖ Integration tests in CI/CD
- ‚úÖ Documentation complete

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps for Development Team

### Immediate Actions (This Week):
1. **Run compliance check**: `make -f Makefile.prd check-prd-compliance`
2. **Review implementation plan**: Read `PRD_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
3. **Choose starting point**: Pick component based on team expertise
4. **Set up stubs**: `make -f Makefile.prd create-missing-files`

### Team Assignments:
- **Backend Teams**: Focus on LoadSim Operator and Pipeline Deployer
- **CLI Teams**: Implement missing pipeline management commands
- **Frontend Teams**: Build Deployed Pipelines and Catalog views
- **DevOps Teams**: Create missing OTel configurations

### Weekly Check-ins:
- Review progress against `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`
- Update completion percentages
- Address blockers and integration issues
- Validate against acceptance criteria

## üéâ Expected Outcomes

Upon completion of this roadmap, the Phoenix Platform will:

‚úÖ **Fully comply** with the Process-Metrics MVP PRD  
‚úÖ **Enable rapid deployment** of optimized OTel pipelines  
‚úÖ **Support safe A/B testing** with clear comparisons  
‚úÖ **Deliver significant cost savings** for New Relic users  
‚úÖ **Maintain 100% critical process visibility**  
‚úÖ **Provide excellent developer experience**
