## 🔧 Quick Start Implementation Guide

### 1. Set Up Development Environment
```bash
# Clone and set up
git clone <phoenix-repo>
cd Phoenix
make setup-dev-env
make dev-up
```

### 2. Run Current Compliance Check
```bash
# Use the provided Makefile
make -f Makefile.prd check-prd-compliance
```

### 3. Create Missing File Stubs
```bash
# Generate stub files for quick start
make -f Makefile.prd create-missing-files

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
1. **OTel Compatibility**: Pin versions, extensive testing
2. **Kubernetes Resource Usage**: Conservative limits, monitoring
3. **Integration Complexity**: Daily integration testing

### Schedule Risks:
1. **Dependency Bottlenecks**: Parallel development where possible
2. **Testing Delays**: Continuous testing throughout development
3. **Scope Creep**: Strict adherence to PRD requirements
