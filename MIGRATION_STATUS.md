# Phoenix Platform Migration Status

## Migration Progress (as of 2025-05-25)

### ‚úÖ Completed Phases

#### Phase 0: Foundation Setup
- Created monorepo directory structure
- Set up `services/`, `packages/`, `infrastructure/`, `monitoring/`, etc.
- Configured workspace files (package.json, turbo.json)

#### Phase 1: Shared Packages Migration
- Migrated authentication utilities to `packages/go-common/auth/`
- Migrated database packages to `packages/go-common/store/`
- Migrated event bus to `packages/go-common/eventbus/`
- Migrated interfaces to `packages/go-common/interfaces/`
- Set up contract definitions in `packages/contracts/`

#### Phase 2: Core Services Migration
Services migrated to `projects/`:
- `api` - API Gateway service
- `controller` - Experiment Controller
- `generator` - Configuration Generator
- `dashboard` - Web Dashboard (React)
- `phoenix-cli` - Command Line Interface

#### Phase 3: Supporting Services Migration
- `analytics` - Analytics Engine
- `benchmark` - Benchmark Service
- `collector` - Telemetry Collector
- `anomaly-detector` - Anomaly Detection Service
- `control-actuator-go` - Control Actuator

#### Phase 4: Operators Migration
- `loadsim-operator` - Load Simulation Kubernetes Operator
- `pipeline-operator` - Pipeline Management Kubernetes Operator

#### Phase 5: Infrastructure Migration
- Kubernetes manifests in `infrastructure/kubernetes/`
- Helm charts in `infrastructure/helm/phoenix/`
- Monitoring configurations in `monitoring/`
- CRDs migrated to `infrastructure/kubernetes/operators/`

### üîÑ In Progress

#### Phase 6: Integration Testing
- Need to validate service communication
- Test import paths and dependencies
- Verify Docker builds
- Check Kubernetes deployments

### ‚è≥ Pending

#### Phase 7: Finalization
- Clean up OLD_IMPLEMENTATION directory
- Update documentation
- Generate final migration report
- Tag release

## Next Steps

1. Run integration tests to validate the migration
2. Update import paths in all Go files
3. Test Docker builds for all services
4. Validate Kubernetes deployments
5. Update CI/CD pipelines

## Known Issues

1. Some packages have empty files that were created by linters
2. Validation scripts need updates for new structure
3. Go workspace configuration needs to be set up

## Migration Coordinator

This migration is being executed by multiple agents working in parallel. The locking mechanism in `.migration/locks/` ensures coordination between agents.

## Validation Commands

```bash
# Check structure
find . -type d -name "projects" -o -name "packages" -o -name "infrastructure"

# Count migrated services
ls -1 projects/ | wc -l

# Verify Go modules
find . -name "go.mod" -type f

# Check Kubernetes resources
find infrastructure/kubernetes -name "*.yaml" | wc -l
```
