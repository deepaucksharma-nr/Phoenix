# Phoenix CLI and Pipeline Deployment API Progress Report

## Completed Tasks

### 1. CLI Structure and Core Components ✅
- Created complete CLI directory structure
- Implemented root command with Cobra framework
- Added version command with build-time variables
- Created comprehensive configuration management
- Added CLI README with usage examples

### 2. Authentication Module ✅
- Implemented login command with secure password input
- Created logout command
- Added authentication status command
- Built JWT-based auth client
- Secure token storage in ~/.phoenix/config.yaml

### 3. Experiment Commands (Partial) ✅
- Created experiment command group
- Implemented `experiment create` with full features:
  - Pipeline selection
  - Target node selectors
  - Parameter support (critical processes, top-k)
  - Overlap detection
  - Force flag for warnings
- Implemented `experiment list` with filtering

### 4. API Client ✅
- Created comprehensive API client for Phoenix
- Defined all necessary types and structures
- Implemented error handling
- Added support for all experiment operations

### 5. Output Formatting ✅
- Created output package with multiple formats
- Support for table, JSON, and YAML output
- Formatted error and success messages
- Overlap warning display

### 6. Pipeline Deployment Backend ✅
- Created database migration (005_create_pipeline_deployments.sql)
- Implemented PipelineDeploymentService
- Added models for pipeline deployments
- Created REST API handlers for pipeline endpoints
- Added deployment history tracking

### 7. Build Integration ✅
- Updated Makefile with CLI build target
- Added required dependencies to go.mod
- Fixed module imports

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Complete CLI Experiment Commands
Still need to implement:
- `experiment status` - Get experiment status
- `experiment start` - Start an experiment
- `experiment stop` - Stop an experiment
- `experiment promote` - Promote winning variant
- `experiment metrics` - View experiment metrics

### 2. Pipeline CLI Commands
Need to create:
- `pipeline list` - List available pipelines
- `pipeline deploy` - Deploy pipeline directly
- `pipeline list-deployments` - List deployments
- `pipeline delete-deployment` - Remove deployment

### 3. API Gateway Integration
- The API gateway is using Gin framework (not Chi as initially assumed)
- Need to integrate pipeline deployment service into API gateway
- Wire up the pipeline handlers in main.go

### 4. Pipeline Operator Integration
- Update Pipeline Operator to recognize direct deployments
- Add label `phoenix.io/deployment-type: "direct"`
- Handle deployment lifecycle for non-experiment pipelines

### 5. Testing
- Unit tests for CLI commands
- Integration tests for pipeline deployment API
- E2E tests for complete workflow

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority (Next 2 hours)
1. Complete remaining CLI experiment commands
2. Integrate pipeline deployment service into API gateway
3. Create pipeline CLI commands

### Short Term (This week)
1. Complete Pipeline Operator integration
2. Write comprehensive tests
3. Create deployment documentation
4. Test end-to-end workflows

### Files Modified/Created

#### CLI Files
- `/cmd/phoenix-cli/main.go`
- `/cmd/phoenix-cli/cmd/root.go`
- `/cmd/phoenix-cli/cmd/version.go`
- `/cmd/phoenix-cli/cmd/auth*.go` (login, logout, status)

- `/cmd/phoenix-cli/internal/client/types.go`
- `/cmd/phoenix-cli/internal/output/output.go`
- `/cmd/phoenix-cli/README.md`

#### Pipeline Deployment API Files
- `/migrations/005_create_pipeline_deployments.sql`
- `/pkg/api/pipeline_deployment_service.go`
- `/pkg/models/pipeline_deployment.go`
- `/cmd/api-gateway/internal/handlers/pipeline.go`

#### Configuration Files
- `/go.mod` (updated with CLI dependencies)
- `/Makefile` (added build-cli target)

## Architecture Insights

1. **API Gateway**: Uses Gin framework, not Chi
2. **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control
3. **Service Communication**: gRPC between services, REST for external
4. **Database**: PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexible data
5. **Deployment**: Kubernetes-native with operators

## Recommendations

1. **Testing Strategy**: Create mock API server for CLI tests
2. **Documentation**: Update API reference with pipeline endpoints
3. **Security**: Ensure proper RBAC for pipeline deployments
4. **Monitoring**: Add metrics for deployment operations

This progress report shows significant advancement on both the CLI and Pipeline Deployment API. The foundation is solid, and completing the remaining tasks will provide Phoenix users with powerful automation capabilities.
