### Architecture Alignment

**✅ Well-Aligned Areas:**
- Service boundaries match documentation
- API contracts (protobuf) align with specs
- Kubernetes resources follow patterns
- Database design matches requirements

**❌ Misaligned Areas:**
- Repository structure (subdirectory vs root)
- Some services completely unimplemented
- Missing integration between components
- No working end-to-end flow

## 🔍 Critical Path Analysis

### Must-Have for MVP (6 weeks)

1. **Week 1-2: Core Services**
   - Complete Experiment Controller
   - Implement Config Generator
   - Wire up service communication

2. **Week 3-4: Kubernetes Integration**
   - Complete Pipeline Operator
   - Test CRD deployment
   - Implement status updates

3. **Week 5-6: Basic UI & Testing**
   - Minimal dashboard functionality
   - Basic integration tests
   - End-to-end experiment flow

### Should-Have for Beta (9 weeks)

- Visual pipeline builder
- Complete A/B testing logic
- Monitoring and alerting
- Performance optimization
- Security implementation

### Nice-to-Have for GA (12 weeks)

- Advanced analytics
- ML-based optimization
- Multi-tenancy
- Cost analytics dashboard
- Comprehensive documentation

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. **Documentation-First Success**
The project exemplifies documentation-first development done right. Every component is thoroughly specified before implementation, reducing ambiguity and rework.

### 2. **Realistic Complexity**
The A/B testing approach for OTel collectors is innovative but complex. The documentation acknowledges this with detailed implementation guidance.

### 3. **Clear Boundaries**
Service boundaries are well-defined, preventing the common microservices pitfall of unclear responsibilities.

### 4. **Production-Ready Design**
Despite incomplete implementation, the design considers production concerns: security, monitoring, scalability, and operations.

## 🚨 Risk Assessment

### High Risks
1. **Kubernetes Operator Complexity**: Requires deep K8s expertise
2. **Performance at Scale**: Untested with high metrics volume
3. **Integration Complexity**: Many moving parts to coordinate
