# Phoenix Platform - Build and Run Review

## Executive Summary

The Phoenix Platform monorepo has been successfully restructured with stub implementations that allow all components to build. However, most functionality beyond the basic API service and process simulator requires implementation.

## Build Status Overview

### ✅ Successfully Building Components

| Component | Status | Location | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------|-------|
| API Service | ✅ Partial Implementation | `cmd/api/main.go` | Basic gRPC/REST server with stub experiment service |
| Process Simulator | ✅ Basic Implementation | `cmd/simulator/main.go` | Can generate process loads |
| Experiment Controller | ✅ Builds (Stub) | `cmd/controller/main.go` | Stub implementation only |
| Config Generator | ✅ Builds (Stub) | `cmd/generator/main.go` | Stub implementation only |
| Pipeline Operator | ✅ Builds (Stub) | `operators/pipeline/cmd/main.go` | Stub implementation only |
| LoadSim Operator | ✅ Builds (Stub) | `operators/loadsim/cmd/main.go` | Stub implementation only |
| Dashboard | ✅ Builds (Simplified) | `dashboard/` | Simplified React app without full UI |

### 🐳 Docker Images

All Docker images can be built successfully:
- `phoenix/api:latest`
- `phoenix/experiment-controller:latest`
- `phoenix/config-generator:latest`
- `phoenix/pipeline-operator:latest`
- `phoenix/loadsim-operator:latest`
- `phoenix/process-simulator:latest`
- `phoenix/dashboard:latest`

## How to Build Everything

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Go 1.21+
# Install Node.js 18+
# Install Docker
```

### Build All Components
```bash
# Clone repository and navigate to phoenix-platform
cd phoenix-platform

# Install dependencies
go mod download
cd dashboard && npm install && cd ..

# Build all Go binaries
make build

# Build all Docker images
make docker
```

### Run Locally

#### Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Check status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

#### Option 2: Run Services Individually
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start PostgreSQL
docker-compose up -d postgres

# Terminal 2: Run API
go run cmd/api/main.go

# Terminal 3: Run Dashboard Dev Server
cd dashboard && npm run dev

# Access services:
# - API: http://localhost:8080
# - Dashboard: http://localhost:5173 (dev) or http://localhost:3000 (docker)
# - Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
# - Grafana: http://localhost:3001
```

## Implementation Status

### Core Functionality Status

| Feature | Status | What's Implemented | What's Missing |
|---------|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| API Service | 🟡 Partial | Basic server, health checks, stub handlers | Real experiment logic, database operations |
| Authentication | 🔴 Not Implemented | JWT structure defined | Token validation, user management |
| Experiment Management | 🔴 Not Implemented | API endpoints defined | Business logic, state management |
| Pipeline Generation | 🔴 Not Implemented | Service structure | YAML generation, Git integration |
| Process Simulation | 🟢 Basic | Can spawn processes | Realistic patterns, profiles |
| K8s Operators | 🔴 Not Implemented | Stub mains | Controller logic, CRD handling |
| Dashboard | 🔴 Not Implemented | Basic React setup | All UI components, API integration |
| Monitoring | 🟡 Partial | Prometheus/Grafana config | Metrics collection, dashboards |

### Package Structure

```
pkg/
├── api/            # ✅ Basic structure, needs implementation
│   ├── experiment_service.go
│   ├── v1/         # ✅ Stub protobuf types
│   └── websocket.go
├── auth/           # ✅ Stub authentication service
├── generator/      # ✅ Stub config generator
├── metrics/        # ✅ Basic Prometheus metrics
├── models/         # ✅ Basic data models
├── store/          # ✅ Database interface (no implementation)
└── utils/          # ✅ Basic utilities
```

## Testing the Build

### 1. Verify Go Builds
```bash
make build
# Should create binaries in build/ directory
ls -la build/
```

### 2. Verify Docker Builds
```bash
make docker
# Should create all Docker images
docker images | grep phoenix
```

### 3. Test Basic Functionality
```bash
# Start services
docker-compose up -d postgres api

# Test API health
curl http://localhost:8080/health
# Expected: {"status":"healthy"}

# Test metrics endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics
# Expected: Prometheus metrics
```

## Known Issues and Limitations

### 1. Missing Implementations
- All Kubernetes operators are stubs
- Database operations are not implemented
- Authentication is not functional
- Config generation doesn't produce real YAML
- Dashboard is a placeholder

### 2. Development Gaps
- No unit tests
- No integration tests
- No CI/CD pipeline
- Limited error handling
- No logging configuration

### 3. Infrastructure Gaps
- No database migrations
- No secret management
- No production configurations
- No monitoring dashboards

## Recommended Next Steps

### Phase 1: Core Implementation (Week 1-2)
1. Implement database operations in `pkg/store`
2. Complete experiment service business logic
3. Add basic authentication
4. Create database migrations

### Phase 2: Operators (Week 3-4)
1. Implement Pipeline Operator with CRD reconciliation
2. Implement LoadSim Operator for job management
3. Add proper Kubernetes client configuration
4. Test operator deployment

### Phase 3: Dashboard (Week 5-6)
1. Implement missing React components
2. Connect to API service
3. Add visual pipeline builder
4. Implement real-time updates

### Phase 4: Integration (Week 7-8)
1. End-to-end testing
2. Performance optimization
3. Documentation updates
4. Production readiness

## Development Tips

### Running Individual Services
```bash
# API with hot reload
air -c .air.toml

# Dashboard with hot reload
cd dashboard && npm run dev

# Run specific operator
go run operators/pipeline/cmd/main.go --kubeconfig ~/.kube/config
```

### Debugging
```bash
# Enable debug logging
export LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Run with delve debugger
dlv debug cmd/api/main.go

# Check service logs
docker-compose logs -f api
```

### Common Commands
```bash
# Format code
make fmt

# Run linters
make lint

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Generate CRDs
make generate
```

## Conclusion

The Phoenix Platform monorepo structure is well-organized and all components can be built successfully. However, the platform requires significant implementation work to become functional. The modular architecture allows for parallel development of different components, and the build system is robust enough to support ongoing development.

The immediate priority should be implementing the core API service functionality and database operations, followed by the Kubernetes operators and dashboard UI.
