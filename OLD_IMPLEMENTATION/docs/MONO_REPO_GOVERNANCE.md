    - pattern: "Service A -> API Gateway -> Service B"
      via: "REST/gRPC"
      
    - pattern: "Service -> Message Queue -> Service"
      via: "Events"
      
    - pattern: "Service -> Shared Database"
      via: "Repository pattern"
      
  forbidden_patterns:
    - pattern: "Direct service-to-service DB access"
      reason: "Violates service boundaries"
      
    - pattern: "Synchronous circular dependencies"
      reason: "Creates tight coupling"
      
    - pattern: "Shared mutable state"
      reason: "Race conditions and complexity"
```

### 2. Data Ownership

```yaml
data_ownership:
  api_service:
    owns:
      - experiments
      - users
      - pipelines
    exposes:
      - "GET /api/v1/experiments"

  operator:
    owns:
      - pipeline_status
      - collector_instances
    exposes:
      - "Kubernetes CRD status"
      - "Metrics endpoints"
```

### 3. API Contracts

```yaml
api_contracts:
  versioning:
    strategy: "URL path versioning"
    format: "/api/v{major}/"
    deprecation_notice: "6 months"
    
  compatibility:
    backward_compatible:
      - Adding optional fields
      - Adding new endpoints
      - Adding new methods
      
    breaking_changes:
      - Removing fields
      - Changing field types
      - Changing behavior
      - Removing endpoints
      
  documentation:
    required:

      - gRPC proto files
      - Migration guides
```

## Dependency Management

### 1. Dependency Policies

```yaml

  approval_required:
    - New production dependencies
    - Major version updates
    - Security-critical libraries
    
  automated_updates:
    - Minor version updates
    - Patch updates
    - Development dependencies
    
  review_cycle:
    frequency: "Monthly"
    actions:
      - Security audit
      - License compliance
      - Unused dependency removal
      - Version consolidation
```

### 2. Shared Package Guidelines

```go
// pkg/README.md
# Shared Package Guidelines

## Creating New Packages

1. Single responsibility principle
2. Minimal external dependencies
3. Comprehensive documentation
4. >90% test coverage
5. Stable API (minimize breaking changes)

## Package Structure

```
pkg/
├── auth/           # Authentication utilities
├── errors/         # Common error types
├── httpclient/     # HTTP client wrapper
├── logging/        # Structured logging
├── metrics/        # Metrics collection
├── middleware/     # HTTP/gRPC middleware
├── testing/        # Test helpers
└── validation/     # Input validation
```

## Usage Rules

1. Import only from `pkg/`, never from `internal/`
2. Don't create circular dependencies
3. Version breaking changes properly
4. Maintain backward compatibility
```

### 3. Version Management

```yaml

## Enforcement

This governance model is enforced through:

1. **Automated checks** in CI/CD pipelines
2. **Code review requirements** in GitHub
3. **Regular audits** by platform team
4. **Metrics tracking** and reporting
5. **Team education** and onboarding

Non-compliance results in:
- PR blocks
- Build failures
- Team notifications
- Escalation to platform lead

Success is measured by:
- Reduced incident rate
- Faster deployment velocity
- Higher code quality metrics
- Team satisfaction scores
