## 🔍 What's Still Missing

### Minor Enhancements Needed

1. **CLI Enhancements**
   - ⚠️ `--watch` flag for experiment status command
   - ⚠️ Additional output formats (HTML) for compare command

2. **Error Propagation**
   - ⚠️ Enhanced error messages from operators to UI
   - ⚠️ Better error context in CLI responses

3. **Documentation**
   - ⚠️ Complete user guide for new features
   - ⚠️ API reference documentation
   - ⚠️ Troubleshooting guide updates

4. **Integration Testing**
   - ⚠️ Full acceptance test suite (AT-P01 to AT-P13)
   - ⚠️ E2E test automation in CI/CD

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Check current build status
make build

# Run the platform
make dev-up

# Deploy a pipeline
phoenix pipeline deploy process-topk-v1 --target-host node-01

# Start an experiment
phoenix experiment create my-test baseline topk
phoenix experiment start my-test

# Monitor with dashboard
open http://localhost:3000
```
