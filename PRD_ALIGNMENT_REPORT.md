# Phoenix Platform - PRD Alignment Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the current Phoenix Platform implementation against the Process-Metrics MVP Product Requirements Document (PRD v2.0). The implementation shows **approximately 65% alignment** with PRD specifications, with strong foundations in core services but significant gaps in CLI features, operators, and UI components.

## Detailed Component Analysis

### 1. Phoenix CLI Implementation

**Alignment Score: 50%**

#### ‚úÖ Implemented (Aligned with PRD):
- **Pipeline Management** (partial):
  - `list` - Lists available pipeline templates
  - `deploy` - Deploys pipelines to target hosts
  - `list-deployments` - Shows deployed pipelines
  
- **Experiment Management**:
  - `create` - Creates experiments
  - `start` (PRD: `run`) - Starts experiments
  - `status` - Shows experiment status
  - `metrics` (PRD: `compare`) - Views experiment metrics
  - `promote` - Promotes winning variant
  - `stop` - Stops experiments
  - `list` - Lists all experiments

#### ‚ùå Missing (Required by PRD):
- **Pipeline Management**:
  - `show <catalog_pipeline_name>` - Display OTel YAML
  - `validate <local_otel_config.yaml>` - Validate configs
  - `status [--target-host]` - Pipeline deployment status
  - `get-active-config` - Retrieve running config
  - `rollback` - Revert to previous version
  - `delete` - Remove deployed pipeline

- **Experiment Management**:
  - `delete <experiment_name>` - Delete experiments
  - `--watch` flag for status monitoring
  - `--output` formats for comparison reports

- **Load Simulation** (entire module):
  - `loadsim start` - Start load simulation
  - `loadsim stop` - Stop simulation
  - `loadsim status` - Check simulation status
  - `loadsim list-profiles` - Available profiles

#### üîß Additional Features (Not in PRD):
- Authentication management (`auth`)
- Benchmarking (`benchmark`)
- Configuration management (`config`)
- Migration tooling (`migrate`)
- Plugin system (`plugin`)

### 2. Control Plane Services

**Alignment Score: 85%**

#### ‚úÖ Implemented (Aligned with PRD):
1. **Experiment Controller Service** - Full implementation with state machine
2. **Config Service** - Template catalog with validation as part of Generator service
3. **Cost/Ingest Benchmarking Service** - Complete with Prometheus integration

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented:
- **Pipeline Deployer Logic** - Service structure exists but core logic incomplete (TODO markers)

### 3. Kubernetes Operators & CRDs

**Alignment Score: 40%**

#### ‚úÖ Implemented:
- All CRD definitions:
  - PhoenixProcessPipeline CRD
  - Experiment CRD
  - LoadSimulationJob CRD
- Pipeline Operator with full reconciliation logic

#### ‚ùå Not Implemented:
- **LoadSim Operator** - Only stub code exists
- **Experiment Operator** - Managed by controller service instead of dedicated operator

### 4. Web Console/Dashboard

**Alignment Score: 60%**

#### ‚úÖ Implemented (Aligned with PRD):
- React-based SPA with authentication
- Process Experiment Dashboard
- Real-time monitoring with WebSocket
- Limited actions (stop/promote) as specified

#### ‚ùå Missing (Required by PRD):
- **Deployed Process Pipelines View** - No dedicated view for host-pipeline mappings
- **Pipeline Catalog View** - No read-only catalog browser

#### üîß Additional Features:
- Interactive Pipeline Builder (beyond PRD scope)
- Experiment Wizard
- Advanced analytics views

### 5. OpenTelemetry Pipeline Configurations

**Alignment Score: 60%**

#### ‚úÖ Implemented (3 of 5):
1. `process-baseline-v1` - Minimal processing
2. `process-priority-filter-v1` (PRD: `process-priority-based-v1`)
3. `process-aggregated-v1` - Process aggregation

#### ‚ùå Missing (2 of 5):
4. `process-topk-v1` - Top K processes by resource usage
5. `process-adaptive-filter-v1` - Adaptive threshold filtering

### 6. Load Simulation Components

**Alignment Score: 20%**

#### ‚úÖ Implemented:
- LoadSimulationJob CRD with profiles (realistic, high-cardinality, process-churn)
- Interface definitions in shared packages

#### ‚ùå Not Implemented:
- LoadSim Operator controller logic
- CLI commands for load simulation
- Actual load generator implementation

## Gap Analysis Summary

### Critical Gaps (High Priority):
1. **Load Simulation System** - Entire component missing implementation
2. **Pipeline Management CLI** - Missing 6 of 8 required commands
3. **LoadSim Operator** - No controller implementation
4. **UI Views** - Missing deployed pipelines and catalog views

### Medium Priority Gaps:
1. **OTel Pipeline Configs** - Missing 2 of 5 required configurations
2. **Pipeline Deployer Service** - Incomplete implementation
3. **Experiment CLI Features** - Missing delete, watch, and output formats

### Low Priority Gaps:
1. **Experiment Operator** - Using service-based approach instead
2. **VM Deployment Support** - Limited to K8s deployments

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Sprint 0-1):
1. **Complete LoadSim Operator** implementation in `/projects/loadsim-operator/`
2. **Implement missing CLI commands** for pipeline management
3. **Add LoadSim CLI module** with all required commands
4. **Complete Pipeline Deployer Service** logic

### Short-term (Sprint 2-3):
1. **Create missing OTel configs** (topk and adaptive-filter)
2. **Add UI views** for deployed pipelines and catalog
3. **Implement experiment delete** and watch functionality
4. **Create load generator** implementation

### Medium-term (Sprint 4-5):
1. **Add VM deployment** support beyond K8s
2. **Enhance error propagation** across all layers
3. **Implement missing CLI output** formats
4. **Add integration tests** for full workflows

## Overall Readiness Assessment

The Phoenix Platform has a solid foundation with core services and experiment management largely implemented. However, significant work remains to achieve full PRD compliance, particularly in:

- Load simulation capabilities (0% complete)
- Pipeline lifecycle management (50% complete)
- Operator implementations (40% complete)
- UI feature completeness (60% complete)

**Estimated effort to achieve 100% PRD compliance: 6-8 weeks** with a focused team addressing the gaps identified above.
