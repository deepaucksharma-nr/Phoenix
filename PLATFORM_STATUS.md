# Phoenix Platform Status

**Last Updated**: May 2025  
**Version**: 2.0.0  
**Status**: Production-Ready (65% PRD Compliant)

## Platform Overview

Phoenix is an observability cost optimization platform that reduces metrics cardinality by up to 90% while maintaining critical visibility. Built as a monorepo with strict architectural boundaries to prevent drift.

## Current State

### Architecture
- **Structure**: Clean monorepo with enforced boundaries
- **Services**: 15 microservices successfully migrated
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes-native with Helm charts
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana integration

### Key Metrics
- **Code Migration**: 1,176 files migrated from phoenix-vnext
- **Archive Reduction**: 4.5M â†’ 952K (79% smaller)
- **Build Success**: 100% of services building
- **Test Coverage**: ~70% unit test coverage
- **E2E Tests**: Core workflows validated

### Service Status

| Service | Status | Language | Purpose |
|---------|--------|----------|---------|
| API Gateway | âœ… Production | Go | External API access |
| Controller | âœ… Production | Go | Experiment orchestration |
| Generator | âœ… Production | Go | Config generation |
| Dashboard | âœ… Production | React | Web UI |
| Analytics | âœ… Production | Go | Data analysis |
| Benchmark | âœ… Production | Go | Performance testing |
| Pipeline Operator | âœ… Production | Go | K8s operator |
| LoadSim Operator | ðŸš§ Stub Only | Go | Load simulation |
| Phoenix CLI | âœ… Production | Go | Command line tool |

### PRD Compliance (65%)

**Complete**:
- Core control plane services
- Experiment management
- Basic pipeline deployment
- Web authentication

**In Progress**:
- Load simulation system (20%)
- Pipeline management CLI (65%)
- Web Console views (60%)

**Not Started**:
- 2 OTel pipeline configs
- 6 CLI commands
- 2 Web views

## Recent Achievements

1. **Monorepo Migration** - Complete transition from mixed structure
2. **Phoenix CLI** - Successfully migrated and operational
3. **E2E Testing** - Full workflow validation implemented
4. **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides created

## Known Issues

1. **LoadSim Operator** - Not implemented (blocks A/B testing)
2. **Pipeline CLI** - Missing key management commands
3. **Web Console** - Limited deployment visibility

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1-2**: Implement LoadSim system
2. **Week 3-4**: Complete CLI and Web views
3. **Week 5-6**: Testing and documentation
