# Phoenix Platform Status Report

## Current Status: OPERATIONAL (with limitations)

### ‚úÖ Working Components

1. **Infrastructure Services**
   - PostgreSQL: ‚úì Running on port 5432
   - Redis: ‚úì Running on port 6379
   - NATS: ‚úì Running on port 4222

2. **Core Services**
   - API Service: ‚úì Running on port 8080 (health endpoint working)
   - Generator Service: ‚úì Running on port 8082
     - Templates endpoint working
     - Configuration generation working
   - Controller Service: ‚ö†Ô∏è  Having database connection issues

3. **Validated Features**
   - Health check endpoints
   - Configuration generation via Generator service
   - Basic service communication

### ‚ö†Ô∏è  Issues Identified

1. **API Service**
   - `/api/v1/experiments` endpoint returning 404
   - Need to verify route registration

2. **Controller Service**
   - Database connection issues (check logs/controller-final.log)
   - May need additional migrations

3. **CLI**
   - Build successful but runtime issues
   - May need environment configuration

### üìù Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Check service status
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8082/health

# List generator templates
curl http://localhost:8082/templates | jq

# Generate a configuration
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"template_id":"basic-otel","experiment_id":"test-1","parameters":{}}'

# Check logs
tail -f logs/api.log
tail -f logs/controller-final.log
tail -f logs/generator.log
```

### üîß Troubleshooting

1. **If services are not responding:**
   ```bash
   # Restart infrastructure
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-fixed.yml restart
   
   # Restart services
   ./scripts/start-services.sh
   ```

2. **Check database connectivity:**
   ```bash
   docker exec phoenix-postgres psql -U phoenix -d phoenix_db -c "SELECT 1;"
   ```

3. **View container logs:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-fixed.yml logs -f
   ```

### üöÄ Next Steps

1. Fix API routing for experiments endpoint
2. Resolve Controller database connection
3. Complete CLI environment setup
4. Implement missing pipeline commands
5. Add integration tests

### üìä Service URLs

- API: http://localhost:8080
- Generator: http://localhost:8082
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
- Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (admin/phoenix)
- Jaeger: http://localhost:16686

## Summary

The Phoenix Platform core infrastructure is running successfully. The Generator service is fully operational and can generate OpenTelemetry configurations. While there are some issues with the API routes and Controller service, the foundation is solid and the platform demonstrates the key concepts of:

- Microservices architecture
- Configuration generation
- Service health monitoring
- Docker-based infrastructure

The platform is ready for further development and debugging.
