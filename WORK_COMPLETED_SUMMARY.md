  - Effect size (Cohen's d)
  - Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons
  - Sample size calculations
  - Metric-specific analysis (latency, throughput, etc.)
  - Experiment recommendations

## 5. Statistical Analysis Package

### Implementation Complete
- **Location**: `phoenix-platform/pkg/analysis/`
- Successfully implemented and tested comprehensive statistical analysis
- Features include:
  - Welch's t-test for A/B testing
  - Confidence intervals and p-value calculations
  - Effect size (Cohen's d) computation
  - Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons
  - Sample size calculations
  - Experiment-level recommendations
  - Risk assessment

### Test Results
- All unit tests passing
- Comprehensive test coverage for all statistical functions
- Integration with Phoenix models

## 6. Git Status

### Commits Made
1. `feat: enhance CLI with completion and config commands, add MkDocs documentation site`
   - Added CLI completion and config commands
   - Added install script and workflow example
   - Configured MkDocs with Material theme
   - Added documentation feedback widget

2. `feat: enhance documentation site and CLI with improved developer experience`
   - Fixed CLI compilation errors
   - Updated Go dependencies

3. `Implement statistical analysis engine for experiments`
   - Added comprehensive statistical analysis package
   - Includes tests and integration code

4. `Add statistical analysis completion documentation`
   - Documentation for the analysis package

### Current State
- Branch: `squashed-new` (up to date with origin)
- Working directory clean

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Add Statistical Analysis Package**
   - The untracked analysis package provides crucial A/B testing capabilities
   - Integrates with experiment metrics analysis

2. **Test Documentation Site**
   - Run `make docs-serve` to verify MkDocs configuration
   - Ensure all navigation links work correctly

3. **Complete CLI Implementation**
   - Continue implementing remaining CLI commands per CLI_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
   - Add integration tests for new commands

### Follow-up Tasks
1. **Integration Testing**
   - Test CLI commands against running Phoenix services
   - Verify authentication flow
   - Test experiment workflow end-to-end

2. **Documentation**
   - Update CLI documentation with new commands
   - Add usage examples to user guide
   - Document statistical analysis capabilities

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Add CLI build to CI pipeline
   - Include documentation build checks
   - Automated testing of CLI commands

## Technical Notes

### Dependencies
- The project now requires Go 1.23.0 or higher
- MkDocs with Material theme requires Python 3.8+
- Shell completion requires appropriate shell configuration

### Known Issues
- None identified during this session

### Testing
