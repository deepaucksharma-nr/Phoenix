# Migration Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback the migration:

## 1. Restore OLD_IMPLEMENTATION
```bash
# Extract the archive
tar -xzf archives/OLD_IMPLEMENTATION-*.tar.gz

# Remove new structure (BE CAREFUL!)
rm -rf projects/ packages/
```

## 2. Restore go.mod files
```bash
# The archive contains all original go.mod files
# No additional action needed
```

## 3. Update imports
```bash
# Imports in OLD_IMPLEMENTATION use original paths
# No changes needed
```

## 4. Cleanup
```bash
# Remove new scripts
rm -rf scripts/deploy-dev.sh scripts/setup-dev-env.sh
rm -rf scripts/validate-*.sh
```

## ⚠️ Warning
Rollback should only be used in emergencies. The new structure provides:
- Better modularity
- Improved security
- Easier maintenance
- Clearer boundaries
