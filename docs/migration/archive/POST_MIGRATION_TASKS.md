# Post-Migration Tasks

## Completed ‚úÖ
1. ‚úÖ Directory structure created
2. ‚úÖ Shared packages migrated (go-common, contracts)
3. ‚úÖ Core services migrated (api, controller, generator)
4. ‚úÖ Supporting services migrated (analytics, benchmark, etc.)
5. ‚úÖ Dashboard migrated with Dockerfile
6. ‚úÖ Operators migrated (loadsim, pipeline)
7. ‚úÖ Infrastructure configs migrated
8. ‚úÖ Integration tests migrated

## Immediate Tasks Required üîß

### 1. Fix Import Paths
- Services are looking for `github.com/phoenix/platform/packages/contracts/proto/v1`
- Actual proto files are in `packages/contracts/proto/phoenix/v1/`
- Need to either:
  - Update import paths in services
  - OR reorganize proto directory structure

### 2. Generate Proto Code
```bash
cd packages/contracts
protoc --go_out=. --go-grpc_out=. proto/**/*.proto
```

### 3. Fix Go Dependencies
```bash
# For each service
cd services/api
go mod tidy

cd ../controller
go mod tidy
# etc.
```

### 4. Update Go Workspace
```bash
cd /Users/deepaksharma/Desktop/src/Phoenix
go work sync
```

### 5. Fix Build Issues
- Some services may have missing dependencies
- Update import paths from OLD_IMPLEMENTATION structure
- Ensure all services can compile

### 6. Docker Build Context
- Current Dockerfiles assume packages are copied in build context
- May need to adjust for monorepo structure
- Consider using Docker BuildKit with proper context

## Testing Checklist üìã

1. [ ] All Go services compile successfully
2. [ ] Dashboard builds with npm
3. [ ] Docker images build for all services
4. [ ] Integration tests pass
5. [ ] No references to OLD_IMPLEMENTATION in code
6. [ ] Kubernetes manifests work with new structure

## Final Cleanup üßπ

Once everything is verified:
1. Archive OLD_IMPLEMENTATION directory
2. Update CI/CD pipelines
3. Update documentation
4. Create release notes

## Known Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Proto imports**: Need to align proto package paths with Go import paths
2. **go.sum corruption**: Some services have malformed go.sum files
3. **Docker contexts**: Multi-stage builds need adjustment for monorepo
4. **Workspace modules**: Some services not properly added to go.work

## Quick Fixes

```bash
# Remove all go.sum files and regenerate
find . -name "go.sum" -type f -delete

# Update all go.mod files
find . -name "go.mod" -type f -execdir go mod tidy \;

# Sync workspace
go work sync
```

The migration structure is complete, but some build configuration adjustments are needed for full functionality.
