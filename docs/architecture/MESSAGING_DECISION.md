# Messaging Infrastructure Decision

## Decision: Use NATS as Primary Messaging System

After analysis, we've decided to use NATS as our primary messaging system because:
1. Lighter weight than Kafka
2. Better suited for our use case
3. Simpler operational overhead

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: NATS Migration (Week 2)
- [ ] Remove Kafka dependencies
- [ ] Update service configurations
- [ ] Migrate existing message patterns
- [ ] Update documentation

### Phase 2: Kafka Deprecation (Week 3)
- [ ] Mark Kafka components as deprecated
- [ ] Add deprecation notices
- [ ] Plan removal for v3.0.0

### Phase 3: Cleanup (v3.0.0)
- [ ] Remove Kafka components
- [ ] Clean up configuration
- [ ] Update deployment manifests

## Technical Details

### NATS Configuration
```yaml
nats:
  server: nats://nats:4222
  cluster: phoenix-cluster
  max_reconnects: 10
  reconnect_wait: 2s
```

### Message Patterns
- Request-Reply
