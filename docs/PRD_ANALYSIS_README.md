# Phoenix Platform PRD Analysis Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) compliance analysis for the Phoenix Platform's Process-Metrics MVP. The analysis was conducted in May 2025 to assess the platform's readiness and create a roadmap to achieve 100% PRD compliance.

   - Impact matrices

### Implementation Support

9. **[guides/PRD_IMPLEMENTATION_EXAMPLES.md](./guides/PRD_IMPLEMENTATION_EXAMPLES.md)**
   - Concrete code examples for all missing components
   - LoadSim Operator implementation
   - Missing CLI commands
   - Web Console components
   - Acceptance test examples

10. **[Makefile.prd](../../Makefile.prd)**
    - Automation tools for compliance checking
    - Stub file generation
    - OTel config generators
    - Test runners

## üéØ Key Findings Summary

### Current Status: 65% PRD Compliant

| Component | Status | Gap |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| CLI Commands | 65% | 6 commands missing |
| Control Plane | 85% | Pipeline deployer incomplete |
| K8s Operators | 40% | LoadSim operator not implemented |
| Web Console | 60% | 2 views missing |
| OTel Configs | 60% | 2 configs missing |
| Load Simulation | 20% | Almost entirely missing |

### Critical Gaps

1. **Load Simulation System** - Blocks A/B testing capability
2. **Pipeline Management CLI** - Blocks user workflows
3. **Web Console Views** - Limited monitoring capability

### Timeline to 100%: 6-7 Weeks

With a team of 4-5 engineers, the platform can achieve full PRD compliance through the sprint plan outlined in the implementation documents.

## üöÄ How to Use These Documents

### For Product Managers
- Start with **PRD_EXECUTIVE_DASHBOARD.md** for business impact
- Review **PRD_COMPLIANCE_ROADMAP.md** for timeline
- Check **PRD_VISUAL_SUMMARY.md** for quick status

### For Engineering Managers
- Read **PRD_ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md** for detailed gaps
- Use **PRD_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** for sprint planning
- Track with **IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md**

### For Developers
- Reference **PRD_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** daily
- Use code from **PRD_IMPLEMENTATION_EXAMPLES.md**
- Follow **PRD_ACTION_PLAN.md** for workflow

### For DevOps/QA
- Check **Makefile.prd** for automation tools
- Review acceptance tests in examples
- Validate with compliance commands

## üìä Tracking Progress

```bash
# Check current compliance status
make -f Makefile.prd check-prd-compliance

# Generate missing file stubs
make -f Makefile.prd create-missing-files

# Run acceptance tests
make test-acceptance
```

## üéâ Success Criteria

The Phoenix Platform will be considered PRD-compliant when:
- All 17 CLI commands are implemented
- Both K8s operators are functional
- All 4 Web Console views are complete
- All 5 OTel configs are validated
- Load simulation generates expected patterns
- All 13 acceptance tests pass
- Performance requirements are met

## üìù Document Maintenance

These documents should be updated as implementation progresses:
- **Daily**: Update IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md
- **Weekly**: Update completion percentages
- **Sprint End**: Update roadmap progress
- **Completion**: Archive and create completion report

*This analysis provides a clear path from 65% to 100% PRD compliance, enabling the Phoenix Platform to deliver on its promise of 40-50% observability cost reduction while maintaining 100% critical process visibility.*
