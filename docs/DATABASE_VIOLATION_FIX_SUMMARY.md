# Database Violation Fix Summary

## Overview
Fixed the database driver violation in the platform-api service by replacing direct SQL imports with proper pkg/database abstractions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Store Interface and Implementation
- **File**: `/projects/platform-api/internal/store/store.go`
  - Created `PipelineDeploymentStore` interface with proper abstraction methods
  - Follows repository pattern for data access

### 2. Created PostgreSQL Store Implementation  
- **File**: `/projects/platform-api/internal/store/postgres_store.go`
  - Implements `PipelineDeploymentStore` using pkg/database/postgres abstractions
  - Uses `PostgresStore` from pkg instead of direct SQL driver
  - Includes proper JSON marshalling for complex fields
  - Implements soft delete pattern with deleted_at timestamp
  - Creates necessary tables and indexes on initialization

### 3. Updated Pipeline Deployment Service
- **File**: `/projects/platform-api/internal/services/pipeline_deployment_service.go`
  - Removed direct `database/sql` import (VIOLATION FIXED)
  - Now uses `store.PipelineDeploymentStore` interface
  - Implemented all CRUD methods with proper logging
  - Added UUID generation for deployment IDs
  - Proper error handling and status management

### 4. Updated API Main Entry Point
- **File**: `/projects/platform-api/cmd/api/main.go`
  - Fixed store initialization to use pkg/database/postgres
  - Added pipeline deployment service initialization
  - Added all pipeline deployment HTTP handlers
  - Added routes for pipeline deployments at `/api/v1/pipelines/deployments`

## Architecture Compliance
- ✅ No direct database driver imports in platform-api
- ✅ Uses pkg/database abstractions properly
- ✅ Follows repository pattern with interface segregation
- ✅ Maintains project boundary integrity

## Remaining Issues
The boundary check revealed another violation in the controller project:
- `projects/controller/internal/store/postgres.go` - Direct import of "github.com/lib/pq"

This should be addressed in a similar manner by creating proper abstractions.

## Next Steps
1. Fix the controller project database violation
2. Continue with load simulator implementation
3. Implement acceptance tests
