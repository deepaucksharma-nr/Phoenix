# Team Task Distribution PR

## PR Description

This pull request adds a comprehensive team task distribution plan based on the Phoenix Platform architecture. The plan divides responsibilities across team members for implementing the platform's core components.

## Key Changes

- Added detailed architecture diagram showing component relationships
- Created component ownership matrix for clear accountability
- Assigned specific deliverables to each team member with reference paths
- Defined core components and their implementation details
- Established a 12-week project timeline with clear milestones
- Provided reference paths for getting started with each component

## Team Structure

The task distribution is organized around the Phoenix Platform's architecture with 10 team members:

- **Palash (Principal Engineer)**: Architecture and design leadership
- **Abhinav (Senior Engineer)**: Infrastructure, Kubernetes, monitoring
- **Srikanth (Senior Engineer)**: API, database, core services
- **Engineers (Shivani, Jyothi, Anitha, Tharun, Tanush, Ramana, Praveen)**: Component implementation

## Implementation Focus

Implementation is structured around core architectural components:

1. **Phoenix API** (Control Plane): Central management system
2. **Phoenix Agent** (Data Plane): Lightweight polling agents
3. **Dashboard**: React-based UI for visualization
4. **Pipeline Framework**: Modular execution engine
5. **Infrastructure & Deployment**: Kubernetes resources
6. **Security Framework**: Authentication, authorization and compliance

## Timeline

The project will be executed in four phases over 12 weeks:
1. Architecture & Design (2 weeks)
2. Core Implementation (5 weeks)
3. Integration & Testing (3 weeks)
4. Documentation & Release (2 weeks)

## Next Steps

1. Team members should review their assigned tasks and references
2. Set up local development environments using provided resources
3. Begin design discussions for their assigned components
4. Schedule architecture review meeting to align on interfaces
