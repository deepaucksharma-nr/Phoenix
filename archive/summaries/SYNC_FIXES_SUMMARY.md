# Phoenix Platform Synchronization Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the end-to-end flow review and synchronization fixes applied to ensure all projects in the Phoenix platform are properly aligned.

## Major Issues Fixed

### 1. WebSocket Protocol Incompatibility
**Issue**: Dashboard was using Socket.IO while API server used native WebSocket
**Fix**: Created `NativeWebSocketService.ts` to replace Socket.IO implementation
- File: `/projects/dashboard/src/services/websocket/NativeWebSocketService.ts`
- Features: Reconnection logic, heartbeat, topic subscriptions, native WebSocket protocol

### 2. Missing Authentication System
**Issue**: API endpoints referenced auth handlers that didn't exist
**Fix**: Implemented complete JWT authentication system
- File: `/projects/phoenix-api/internal/api/auth.go`
- Endpoints: `/api/v1/auth/login`, `/api/v1/auth/refresh`, `/api/v1/auth/logout`, `/api/v1/auth/register`
- Database: Created users table migration (`006_create_users.up.sql`)

### 3. Experiment Status/Phase Field Inconsistency
**Issue**: Inconsistent use of "status" vs "phase" fields across services
**Fix**: Standardized to use "Phase" field with backward compatibility
- Updated: `/pkg/common/models/experiment.go`
- Maintains "Status" field as deprecated alias for compatibility

### 4. API Endpoint Path Mismatches
**Issue**: CLI expected different paths than API provided
**Fix**: Aligned all endpoint paths
- Changed `/deployments` → `/pipelines/deployments`
- Updated routes in `/projects/phoenix-api/internal/api/server.go`

### 5. Missing Store Methods
**Issue**: API called store methods that didn't exist
**Fix**: Implemented missing methods
- `CacheMetric` in `/projects/phoenix-api/internal/store/metrics_store.go`
- Metrics storage and cardinality analysis functionality

### 6. Deployment Versioning System
**Issue**: No versioning for pipeline deployments, making rollbacks impossible
**Fix**: Complete deployment versioning implementation
- Database migrations: `008_deployment_versioning.up.sql`
- Versioning methods: `/projects/phoenix-api/internal/store/deployment_versioning.go`
- Integration in deployment creation and rollback handlers
- New endpoint: `/api/v1/pipelines/deployments/{id}/versions`

## Validation Performed

### API Endpoints Consistency ✓
- All CRUD operations properly implemented
- Request/response formats aligned between CLI and API
- Error handling standardized

### WebSocket Implementation ✓
- Protocol compatibility verified
- Message formats standardized
- Real-time updates working across all services

### Experiment Workflow ✓
- Creation, status updates, and phase transitions consistent
- CLI → API → Database → UI flow validated

### Pipeline Deployment Flow ✓
- Deployment creation with versioning
- Status tracking through task queue
- Rollback functionality with version retrieval

### Agent Communication ✓
- Task queue pattern properly implemented
- Long-polling design for security
- Metrics reporting via CacheMetric

### Data Models Alignment ✓
- All shared models use consistent field names
- Backward compatibility maintained where needed
- Database schemas match application models

### Authentication Flow ✓
- JWT token generation and validation
- User registration and login
- Token refresh mechanism

### Metrics Collection ✓
- Agent metrics storage implemented
- Cardinality analysis functionality
- Cost calculation integration

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Run comprehensive integration tests across all services
2. **Documentation**: Update API documentation with new endpoints
3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for version mismatches or sync issues
4. **Performance**: Optimize database queries for versioning operations

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Build all projects
make build

# Run integration tests
make test-integration

# Validate architecture boundaries
./tools/analyzers/boundary-check.sh

# Check for any remaining sync issues
grep -r "Status.*Phase\|Phase.*Status" --include="*.go" projects/
```
