## 🔧 Technical Achievements

### Module Structure Consistency
```
All modules now use: github.com/phoenix/platform/*
├── packages/go-common
├── packages/contracts  
├── services/*
├── projects/*
└── operators/*
```

### Import Path Consistency
```go
// Before (phoenix-vnext)
import "github.com/phoenix-vnext/platform/cmd/phoenix-cli/internal/client"

// After (phoenix)
import "github.com/phoenix/platform/projects/phoenix-cli/internal/client"
```

### Go Workspace Configuration ✅
All modules properly configured in `go.work`:
- packages/go-common
- packages/contracts
- projects/phoenix-cli ← **Primary target**
- services/*
- projects/*
- operators/*
