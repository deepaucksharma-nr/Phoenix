### ðŸ”„ Needs Update for New Implementation

1. **Service Locations**: OLD_IMPLEMENTATION had services in different structure
   - Update all service paths to reflect projects/ structure
   - Remove references to phoenix-platform/ subdirectory

2. **Import Paths**: Update all Go import paths
   - From: `github.com/phoenix/phoenix-platform/...`
   - To: `github.com/phoenix/platform/...`

3. **Docker & Kubernetes**: Update deployment configs
   - New docker-compose structure
   - Updated Kubernetes manifests in deployments/

4. **CI/CD**: Update pipeline documentation
   - New GitHub Actions structure
   - Monorepo-aware CI/CD

5. **Testing**: Update test documentation
   - New test structure in tests/
   - Integration test updates

## Migration Process

1. **Phase 1**: Core Documentation (Priority: High)
   - API documentation
   - Architecture documentation
   - Development guides

2. **Phase 2**: Operational Documentation (Priority: Medium)
   - Deployment guides
   - Runbooks
   - Monitoring documentation

3. **Phase 3**: Reference Documentation (Priority: Low)
   - ADRs
   - Technical specifications
   - Planning documents

## Key Differences in New Implementation

1. **Monorepo Structure**
   - All services under projects/
   - Shared packages in pkg/
   - Common tooling in tools/

2. **Build System**
   - Unified Makefile system
   - Go workspace (go.work)
   - Shared build infrastructure

3. **Service Independence**
   - Each project is completely independent
   - No cross-project imports allowed
   - Boundary enforcement via tools

4. **Development Workflow**
   - Single repository setup
   - Unified CI/CD
   - Consistent tooling across projects

5. **Documentation Structure**
   - Centralized in docs/
   - Project-specific docs in projects/*/docs/
   - Automated documentation generation
