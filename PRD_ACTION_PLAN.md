## 🛠️ Daily Workflow

### Morning Standup Questions
1. What PRD requirement did I complete yesterday?
2. What PRD requirement am I working on today?
3. Are there any blockers to PRD compliance?

### End of Day Checklist
- [ ] Update IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md with progress
- [ ] Run relevant tests for today's work
- [ ] Check for integration impacts
- [ ] Commit with clear PRD reference

### Weekly Review (Fridays)
- [ ] Run compliance check: `make -f Makefile.prd check-prd-compliance`
- [ ] Update completion percentages
- [ ] Review next week's targets
- [ ] Address any blockers
