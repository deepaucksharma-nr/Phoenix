# Boundary Validation Fixes Complete

## Issue Resolution

### Original Error
- Pre-commit hook failed with "Cross-project import violations detected!"

### Root Causes Fixed

1. **Validation Script Issues**
   - Script was checking removed `/packages/` directory
   - Updated to check `/pkg/` directory instead
   - Fixed all directory references in validation script

2. **Old Import Paths**
   - Found and fixed `github.com/phoenix-vnext/platform` imports
   - Updated to `github.com/phoenix/platform` throughout codebase
   - Files updated:
     - `projects/controller/` - multiple files
     - `phoenix-platform/cmd/phoenix-cli/internal/completion/completion.go`

3. **Script Updates**
   - `scripts/validate-boundaries.sh` now correctly validates:
     - Cross-project imports (none found ✅)
     - Package imports from projects (none found ✅)
     - Old import paths (all fixed ✅)

## Validation Results

```
=== Boundary Validation Summary ===
Violations: 0
Warnings: 7
```

### Warnings (Non-Critical)
The 7 warnings are about missing replace directives in go.mod files for projects that may not actually use those packages:
- controller (1 warning)
- generator (2 warnings)
- hello-phoenix (2 warnings)
- phoenix-cli (2 warnings)

These are informational only and don't affect functionality.

## Verification

The monorepo boundaries are now properly enforced:
- ✅ No cross-project imports
- ✅ No packages importing from projects
- ✅ All imports use correct module paths
- ✅ Validation script updated for current structure

## Pre-commit Hook Status

The pre-commit hook should now pass the boundary validation check. The codebase maintains proper architectural boundaries with:
- Projects only importing from `/pkg/*`
- No cross-project dependencies
- Clean module structure
